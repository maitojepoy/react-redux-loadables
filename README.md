##React.js + Redux + React-Loadable

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is one of my first tries with the new React CLI using React.js, Redux and React-Loadable for the routing code.

One of the coolest thing in using React-Loadable is you don't need configuration in your webpack side. Just add a code to point out your container component as a bundle. See https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html on how to use react-loadable. Saves you a lot of time :)
